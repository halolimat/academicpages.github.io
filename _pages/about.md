~~Currently pursuing~~ PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at [Wright State University](http://www.wright.edu/) ~~working as part of the research team at The Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing ([Kno.e.sis](http://www.knoesis.org/))~~. My dissertation titled "Knowledge-enabled Entity Extraction" is advised by [Dr. Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan](http://knoesis.wright.edu/tkprasad/).

~~Kno.e.sis performs world-class research on translating information to meaning, towards the vision of Computing for Human Experience. My research is focused on Natural Language Processing, Information and Knowledge Retrieval and Extraction, and Machine Learning.~~

Previously, received MSc. in Computer Science and Engineering from [the University of Toledo](http://knoesis.wright.edu/tkprasad/). My research and thesis work was focused on the development of multi-level and multi-objective optimization techniques through the development of [Metaheuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic) (mainly using [Bio-Inspired Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic)).

Before joining the master's program at UT, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [German Jordanian University](https://www.gju.edu.jo), Amman, Jordan.
