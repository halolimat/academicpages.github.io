title: "A Pipeline for Disaster Response and Relief Coordination"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Natural disasters such as floods, forest fires, and hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage to human life and infrastructure. We focus on response to hurricanes caused by both river water flooding and storm surge. Using models for storm surge simulation and flood extent prediction, we generate forecasts about areas likely to be highly affected by the disaster. Further, we overlay the simulation results with information about traffic incidents to correlate traffic incidents with other data modality. We present these results in a modularized, interactive map-based visualization, which can help emergency responders to better plan and coordinate disaster response.'

Natural disasters such as floods, forest fires, and hurricanes can cause catastrophic damage to human life and infrastructure. We focus on response to hurricanes caused by both river water flooding and storm surge. Using models for storm surge simulation and flood extent prediction, we generate forecasts about areas likely to be highly affected by the disaster. Further, we overlay the simulation results with information about traffic incidents to correlate traffic incidents with other data modality. We present these results in a modularized, interactive map-based visualization, which can help emergency responders to better plan and coordinate disaster response.
